Hi My name is Ambika Valagonda

Full-stack developer
I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with experience in building dynamic and robust applications using modern technologies. I have a solid background in Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and microservices architecture. I enjoy creating seamless user experiences with React.js and have a knack for deploying applications to the cloud using AWS. My projects showcase my skills in software development, from creating a quiz application with microservices to developing a student management system and a CRM application. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master’s degree from Wilmington University and have worked on exciting projects, including a feature for group video calls for hospital staff. I'm constantly learning and expanding my skill set to stay updated with the latest industry trends. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
